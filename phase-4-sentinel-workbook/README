# Phase 4 – Sentinel Workbook + Basic Analytics Rule

This phase adds a lightweight visualization layer on top of the secure infrastructure and telemetry pipeline.  
Microsoft Sentinel is used only for monitoring dashboards and simple analytics, since advanced SOAR/SIEM features were already implemented in my other Sentinel-focused projects.

## What Was Added

### ✔️ Sentinel Activation
Microsoft Sentinel was enabled on the Log Analytics workspace (`law-secure-infra`).

### ✔️ Workbook
A simple workbook was created for:
- Syslog volume
- Performance metrics
- VM heartbeat

The purpose is to visualize logs coming from AMA + DCR, not to build a full SOC dashboard.

### ✔️ Analytics Rule
A basic scheduled rule was created:

**SSH Failed Password Attempts > 3 in 5 minutes**

Used to demonstrate how telemetry can trigger an alert.

## Status
Phase 4 completed. Sentinel is used here only as a visibility layer.
