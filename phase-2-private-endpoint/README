# Phase 2 — Key Vault Private Endpoint + Disable Public Access

This phase applies network hardening to Key Vault by enforcing private-only access.

## 🔐 Key Improvements

- Added a **Private Endpoint** (`pe-kv`) for Key Vault
- Configured **Private DNS Zone** for vault name resolution
- Disabled **Public Network Access** on Key Vault
- Ensures the VM can access Key Vault only through the internal VNet
