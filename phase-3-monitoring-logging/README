# Phase 3 — AMA + DCR Telemetry Validation (Syslog & Perf)

This phase validates that Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) and the Data Collection Rule (DCR) are correctly sending telemetry from the VM to Log Analytics.

---

## ✅ What Was Validated

- VM `vm-secure-ubuntu` sends **Heartbeat** to Log Analytics.
- Syslog events are collected via DCR and stored in the `Syslog` table.
- Performance counters (CPU, memory, disk) are collected and visible in the `Perf` table.
- Log Analytics queries confirmed:

### Syslog

```kusto
Syslog
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
| where Computer == "vm-secure-ubuntu"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, Facility, SeverityLevel, SyslogMessage
| top 50 by TimeGenerated desc


### Performance Counters

Perf
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
| where Computer == "vm-secure-ubuntu"
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by CounterName
| top 20 by avg_CounterValue desc
